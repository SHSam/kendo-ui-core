# Breaking Changes

[Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC](http://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc) is a set of server-side wrappers that allows using the [Kendo UI widgets](../kendo-ui/introduction) from C# or VB.NET code.

That is why, all important changes in the Kendo UI suite also apply to the client-side code and behavior of the UI for ASP.NET MVC wrappers. For the list of all breaking changes, refer to the articles on the [Kendo UI breaking changes](../kendo-ui/backwards-compatibility/2017-backward-compatibility).
